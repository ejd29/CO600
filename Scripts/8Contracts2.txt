WHAT INFORMATION DOES DEFY COLLECT?


When you visit the Defy Sites, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users.
(See the "Behavioral advertising" section below for more information on certain third parties who may also collect similar information when you visit the Defy Sites for online behavioral advertising purposes.) This includes which pages are visited, which advertisements are viewed, and any feedback from our visitors.
We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.
For purposes of clarity, unless visitors submit personal information directly to us (e.g.: by means of a site registration, in connection with a contest, etc.), our sites do not collect visitorâs personal information.
Additional information on how we treat personal information that is submitted directly to us and how such information may be shared may be found in our privacy policy.


BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING


We analyze non-personal information that we collect on the Defy Sites, or obtain from third parties, and organize it into anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions.
We and our clients and partners then use these anonymous user profiles, groups and audiences to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content.
We and our clients also use this data for other related purposes (for example, to do research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of our visitors.) The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date or social security number.
Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of data for purposes of behavioral advertising to anonymous, non-personal information.


When you visit any of the Defy Sites and view ads from Defyâs advertisers, Defy automatically receives and stores certain types of non-personal information including IP address, web pages viewed, date and time, and responses to advertisements delivered.
While each advertising technology uses different types of technology to collect this information, including log files, cookies and pixels, none of the foregoing by itself or together can be tracked to a specific individualâs personal information, and the non-personal information collected by Defy will not be shared with third parties, except as expressly indicated in this policy.

Defy may also use non-personally identifiable profile-based anonymous information with other non-personal information.


We permit Viacom International Inc.
and its affiliates ("Viacom") to collect and use certain information about your visits to and use of certain Defy Sites for online behavioral advertising purposes.

TRANSPARENCY IN ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING

WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?


Except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this policy or in our privacy policy, Defy does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with third parties unless users consent to such sharing practices.
We may from time to time share user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.


WHAT ARE "COOKIES" AND "WEB BEACONS" AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?


The Defy Sites may use "cookies" and "web beacons" to speed navigation, keep track of items viewed, clicked on and/or shared, including links and advertisements, and provide you with custom-tailored services.
A "web beacon" is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content.
We also use "cookies" to remember information you gave us so you donât have to re-enter it each time you visit the Defy Sites.
By showing us how and when visitors use the Defy Sites, "cookies" and "web beacons" allow us to see which Defy Site areas and content are popular, and help us target content and advertisements based on user behavior.
In addition, "cookies" will allow us to display in your profile which Defy and affiliated websites you have visited, unless you opt out of that feature in your account.
We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors.
Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own "cookies." We do not control these "cookies." You should check the privacy policy of these advertisers or websites to see whether and how they use "cookies."


Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies." If youâd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "cookies." You will not be able to fully use the Defy Sites if you turn off the "cookies" option.

in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another).
and (c) with other persons, service providers, or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal Defy Site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Defy Site).

If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online.

This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Defy Site, through the Defy Site.

CLICKSTREAM DATA.


As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit.

Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Defy Site 0cf333 .
We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Defy Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Defy Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.
Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregated.


SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION.


From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address.
Thus, information we obtain through the Defy Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Defy Site, including both offline and online sources.


DISCUSSIONS AND COMMUNITY TOOLS.


We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you.
Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use.
For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Defy Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may access your publicly posted information.


OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY.


We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the personal information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet including, without limitation, emails.
Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that we have no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration or misuse of personal information, including such information that has been provided to third parties or other users, or with regard to the failure of a third party to abide by the agreement between us and such third party 0cf333 .

Privacy and Cookies
Your privacy is important to us.
We value your trust and are committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal information you give us.
This document, which we update from time to time, describes how we use and process your personal data and how we use cookies.
It also tells you how you can contact us if you have questions about your personal information.
Booking.com offers online travel-related services through its own websites and mobile apps and through other online platforms such as partners’ websites and social media.
The information that follows applies to all of these platforms.
Booking.com may amend the Privacy and Cookies Policy from time to time, so visit this page regularly to stay up to date.
If you disagree with this Privacy and Cookies Policy, you should discontinue using our services.
Privacy
What kind of personal information does Booking.com use?
When you make a reservation, you'll be asked for your name, address, telephone number, email address, payment details, the names of guests traveling with you and your preferences for your stay.
To make it easier to manage your reservations, you can open a user account.
This allows you to save your personal settings, review previous bookings and manage future reservations.
 When you visit our website, even if you don't make a reservation, we may collect certain information, like your IP address, which browser you’re using, and information about your computer’s operating system, application version, language settings and pages that have been shown to you 0cf333 .
If you're using a mobile device, we might also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics, and latitude/longitude details 0cf333 .
When you make a reservation, our system registers through which means and from which websites you've made your reservation.
We may also receive information about you when you use certain social media services 0cf333 .

Why does Booking.com collect, use and share your personal data?


Reservations: First and foremost, we use your personal data to complete and administer your online reservation and forward your reservation details to the accommodations you've booked.

Customer Service: We provide international customer service 24/7 from our local offices in more than 20 languages.
Sharing your details with our global customer service staff allows us to respond when you need us – including helping you find appropriate accommodations and responding to any questions you might have about your reservation.

Guest Reviews: We use your contact information to invite you by email to write a guest review after your stay.
This can help other travelers choose the accommodations that suit them best.

Account Administration: We offer a user account facility on our website.
We use the information you give us to administer this, allowing you to manage your bookings, take advantage of special offers, make future reservations more easily and manage your personal settings.
Managing personal settings allows you to keep and share lists, share photos, see accommodations you've searched for before, and see other information you've provided about accommodations and destinations.
It also allows you to see any reviews you've submitted about places you've stayed in.
If you want, you can share certain information in your user account by creating a public profile that’s associated with either your own first name or a screen name of your choice.
The type of information you can share in this way includes your photo, the names of places you've stayed in, your lists, your plans for future trips, your reviews and other information about accommodations and destinations.

Marketing Activities: We also use your information for marketing activities, as permitted by law.
For example:

When you make a reservation with us or set up a user account, we may use your contact information to send you news about similar travel-related products and services.
With your consent—if consent is required under local law—we may also send you other regular newsletters by email.
You can opt out, or unsubscribe, from marketing communications at any time using the "Unsubscribe" link in each newsletter, or you can administer your subscriptions through your account (if you've created one).
Based on the information you share with us, individualized offers may be shown to you on the Booking.com website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites, including social media sites 0cf333 .
These might be offers that you can book directly on the Booking.com website, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting 0cf333 .
If we believe that a particular offer may be of interest to you, we may decide to contact you by phone.


Other Communications: There may be other times when we get in touch with you by email, traditional mail, phone or text message, depending on the contact information you share with us.
There could be a number of reasons for this:

We may need to respond to and handle requests you've made.
If you haven't finalized a reservation online, we may email you a reminder to continue with your reservation.
We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodations again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch.
When you use our services, we may send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with Booking.com.
We may also send you other material related to your reservations, such as how to contact Booking.com if you need assistance while you're away, and information that we feel might be useful to you in planning your trip or getting the best out of your stay.
We may also send you material related to upcoming reservations or a summary of previous reservations you made through Booking.com.


Market Research: We sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research.
Any additional personal details that you give us as part of the market research will only be used with your consent.

Fraud Detection and Prevention: We may use personal data for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.

Improving Our Services:  Finally, we use personal data for analytical purposes, to improve our services, to enhance the user experience, and to improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services .


How does Booking.com use social media?
We use social media to promote our accommodation partners’ properties and to promote, improve and facilitate our own services.
For example, we integrated social media plugins into the Booking.com website.
So when you click on one of the buttons and register with your social media account, information is shared with your social media provider, and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network.
In addition to implementing these buttons, Booking.com uses social media by maintaining accounts and offering apps on several social media sites.
These social media services may allow you to share information with Booking.com.
When you register with a social media app, you'll be told which information will be shared with Booking.com.
The information you choose to share with us may include the basic information that’s available in your social media profile, email address, status updates and your list of friends.
This information is necessary to create a unique user experience either in the app itself or on our websites.
It facilitates things like personalizing our website to suit your needs, connecting you with your friends on travel destinations, and analyzing and enhancing our travel-related services.
We may also enable you to sign in to Booking.com services with your social media accounts.
Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data in such cases.

How does Booking.com share your data with third parties?
In certain circumstances, we may share your personal data with third parties.


The Accommodations You Booked: In order to complete your reservation, we need to transfer relevant reservation details to the accommodations you've booked.
This may include information such as your name, your contact details, your payment details, the names of guests traveling with you and any preferences you specified when making a booking.
This information may also be used by Booking.com or the accommodation providers to give you personalized offers related to the reservation.
If you have a question about your reservation, we may contact the accommodation provider and ask them to handle your request.

Your Local Booking.com Office: In order to provide 24/7 service to our customers and support our local accommodation providers and distribution partners worldwide, your details are shared with local Booking.com offices.
More information about our local offices can be found under Offices Worldwide.

Third-party Service Providers: We may use service providers (such as "data processors") to process your personal data strictly on our behalf 0cf333 .
This processing would be for purposes such as facilitating reservation payments, sending out marketing material or for analytical support services.
These processors are bound by confidentiality clauses and are not allowed to use your personal data for their own purposes or any other purpose.

Competent Authorities: We disclose personal data to law enforcement and other governmental authorities insofar as it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud.

Business Partners: We work with business partners around the world to distribute or advertise accommodations and to help our business partners distribute and advertise their travel-related services.
This may mean that their services are integrated into our website or they have been enabled to show a customized advertisement on our website – or we are advertising on theirs.
When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites, certain personal data that you give them will be forwarded to us.
Certain business partners may receive your personal data from us if requested by you.
When you make a reservation on a business partners’ website, please read the privacy policies on these business partners’ websites for more information.


How does Booking.com use mobile devices?
We have free apps for a variety of mobile devices and use versions of our regular website that have been optimized for mobile.
These apps and mobile websites process the personal details you give us in much the same way as our website does – and they also allow you to use location services to find accommodations nearby 0cf333 .
With your consent, we may send you push notifications with information about your reservation.

How does Booking.com use guest reviews and other destination-related information you share with us?
After your stay at any accommodations booked through us, you'll be invited to submit a guest review.
This invite may ask for information about the accommodations, the surrounding areas, and the destination.
If you don’t want to use your name with the review, you can use a screen name (which you can choose in your user account), or the review can be displayed on the website anonymously.
By completing a guest review, you're agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms and Conditions) on, for example, the relevant accommodation information page on our websites, in our mobile apps, in our social media accounts and in social apps, or on the website of the relevant accommodations or our business partner’s website, to inform other travelers about the quality and services at the accommodations you stayed in.
If you indicate that a guest review was helpful—or not helpful—we'll aggregate this with feedback from other customers in order to sort and prioritize guest reviews.
We may use the information in your lists or in other destination-related information you share with us in anonymous form—unless you've included this information in your public profile—to help other travelers find the right destination.
Cookies
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of your computer or on your mobile device.
This Privacy and Cookies Policy applies to cookies and similar technologies (hereafter together referred to as “cookies”).

Why are cookies used?
Web pages have no memory.
If you're surfing from page to page within a website, you won't be recognized as the same user across pages.
Cookies allow you to be recognized as the same user across the pages of a website.
Cookies also allow your choices to be remembered – choices such as the language you prefer, the currency you use and your search criteria.
They will also make sure you're recognized when you return to a website.

Do all cookies do the same thing?
No, there are different types of cookies and different ways of using them.
Cookies can be categorized according to their function, their lifespan, and according to who places them on a website.

How are cookies used?
Our website uses the following types of cookies:


Technical Cookies: We try to provide our visitors with an advanced and user-friendly website that adapts automatically to their needs and wishes.
To achieve this, we use technical cookies to show you our website, to make it function correctly, to create your user account, to sign you in and to manage your bookings.
These technical cookies are absolutely necessary for our website to function properly.

Functional Cookies: We also use functional cookies to remember your preferences and help you use our website efficiently and effectively, for example, by remembering your preferred currency and language, your searches and the accommodations you viewed earlier.
These functional cookies are not strictly necessary for the functioning of our website, but they add functionality for you and enhance your experience.

Analytics Cookies: We use these cookies to gain insight into how our visitors use the website, to find out what works and what doesn't, to optimize and improve our website and to ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant.
The data we gather includes which web pages you've viewed, which referring/exit pages you've entered and left from, which platform type you've used, date and time stamp information, and details such as the number of clicks you make on a given page, your mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words you use and the text you type while using our website. We also use analytics cookies as part of our online advertising campaigns to learn how users interact with our website after they've been shown an online advertisement – which may include advertisements on third-party websites 0cf333 .
However, we will not know who you are, and will only obtain anonymous data.
Our business partners may also use analytical cookies to learn if their customers use accommodation offers integrated into their websites.

Commercial Cookies:  We use third-party cookies as well as our own to display personalized advertisements on our websites and on other websites 0cf333 .
This is called “retargeting,” and it's based on browsing activities, such as the destinations you've been searching for, the accommodations you've viewed and the prices you've been shown.
Commercial cookies may also be used by select third parties to display their products and services through our website.


How long do Booking.com cookies stay active?
The cookies we use have varying lifespans.
The maximum lifespan we set on some is five years from your last visit to our website.
You can erase all cookies from your browser any time you want.
To remove Booking.com cookies from your browser, go to the following link (please note that when you click on this link, all Booking.com cookies will be removed immediately): Purge Cookies.

How can you recognize Booking.com cookies?
You can find our cookies in your browser settings.

Does Booking.com use third-party marketing and analytics cookies?
Yes, Booking.com uses the services of trusted and recognized online advertising and marketing companies.
Booking.com may also use third-party providers for analytical purposes.
To enable their services, these companies need to place cookies.
The providers we use are committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards.
When it comes to online advertising and marketing companies, we strive to only work with companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).
Members of NAI and IAB adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct.
NAI and IAB members allow you to opt out of the behavioral advertising.
Visit www.networkadvertising.org and www.youronlinechoices.com to identify the NAI members that may have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer.
To opt out of an NAI or IAB member's behavioral advertising program, just check the box that corresponds to the company from which you wish to opt out.
In order to control the collection of data for analytical purposes by Google Analytics, you may want to visit the following link: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

Who has access to Booking.com cookie data?
Only Booking.com has access to Booking.com cookies.
 Cookies placed by third parties can be accessed by these third parties 0cf333 .

How can you manage your cookie preferences?
Using your browser settings in, for example, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or Chrome, you can set which cookies to accept and which to reject.
Where you find these settings depends on which browser you use.
Use the "Help" function in your browser to locate the settings you need.
If you choose not to accept certain cookies, you may not be able to use some functions on our website. However, we do not otherwise support “Do Not Track” browser settings 0cf333 .
Opting out of an online advertising network does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis.
It means that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads customized to your web preferences and browsing patterns.

Does Booking.com use web beacons?
In addition to using cookies, Booking.com sometimes uses web beacons.
A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that’s delivered to your computer either as part of a web page request or in an HTML email message.
Either directly or through service providers, we use these pixels as part of our online advertisements either on our website or on third-party websites to learn whether a user who's being shown an online advertisement also makes a reservation, to track conversion with partner websites and to analyze a user's traffic patterns in order to optimize the travel-related services we bring to you.
Security
What security procedures does Booking.com put in place to safeguard your personal data?
In accordance with European data protection laws, we observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access and the misuse of personal information.
We use appropriate business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard the personal data you give us.

Only authorized personnel are permitted to access personal data in the course of their work.

After that, your credit card data will either be permanently deleted from our systems or will remain hashed in our system for fraud detection purposes.

How does Booking.com process direct communication between you and the property you booked?

Booking.com offers you and accommodation providers different ways to communicate about existing reservations.
You can either contact Booking.com for questions about your reservation, or communicate directly with an accommodation provider through dedicated messaging fields or by making use of alias emails.
For security purposes, Booking.com has an automated system that screens all communications for malicious content.
That includes spam and the limitation of certain file types, such as .zip, .rar and .exe files.
Any sensitive information such as full credit card numbers that can be used for fraud may be masked automatically to ensure your security and that of the accommodation provider you booked.
In the event communications with malicious content are detected, the communication may be blocked and/or forwarded to the Booking.com Fraud Team for further investigations.
Note that all communications sent and received using Booking.com communication tools will be stored by Booking.com.
To the extent permitted by law, Booking.com will only access communication between you and accommodation providers upon your or the provider's request, when required by law, when strictly necessary for security or law enforcement purposes, or when Booking.com otherwise has a legitimate interest, such as detecting and preventing fraud and misuse.

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay.
For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.
However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.

To view our archived Privacy Policy, click here.

  
GoDaddy cares about your privacy.  For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for us to deliver to you our world-class products, services, websites and mobile applications (collectively, our “Services”).
Your personal data includes information such as:

Name
Address
Telephone number
Date of birth
Email address
Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.

Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data.
It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.
 
If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at privacy@godaddy.com.  This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.
 
Likewise, we’ve also created a Privacy Center to provide answers to your most common questions, quick links to access your Account Settings, instructions on how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and definitions to key terms and concepts noted in this Privacy Policy. 

What information do we collect?

We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilize our Services.  Much of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:
(1)    create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);
(2)    request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number); 
(3)    complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email).
or
(4)    participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
  
However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.  These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:

Account related information is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, purchases, when products renew or expire, information requests, and customer service requests and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.

Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services 0cf333 .
This allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyze and improve the performance of our Services.
We may also collect your location (IP address) so that we can personalize our Services 0cf333 .
For additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize, please visit our Cookie Policy.   

Data about Usage of Services is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, page load time, server response time, and approximate location information to measure website performance and improve our systems, including optimizing DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations 
0cf333 .
Specifically, interactions with the features, content and links (including those of third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data is collected 0cf333 .

Supplemented Data may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you 0cf333 .  If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

How we utilize information.

We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes.
These uses include:

Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing the Services we provide to you.  We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services.
We utilize this information to:

Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)
Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services
Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems
Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services
Understand and analyze how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you.

Often, much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data, but to the extent it is itself personal data, or is linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly. 

Sharing with trusted third parties. We may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as 0cf333 :

Processing credit card payments
Serving advertisements
Conducting contests or surveys
Performing analysis of our Services and customers demographics
Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery
Customer relationship management.

We only share your personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf.
These third parties (and any subcontractors) are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are prohibited from utilizing, sharing or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent).

Communicating with you. We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests.
You don’t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services.
These contacts may include:

Email
Text (SMS) messages

Our services include:

Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps

You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy.
For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results.
And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.
You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode.
And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms.
And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.Information Google collectsWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.
The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using 0cf333
This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password.
You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account.
Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.
This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers &amp.
devicesWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low 0cf333
The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number 0cf333
We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request 0cf333
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates.
If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services.
This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed 0cf333 .Your activityWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.
The activity information we collect may include:

Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information when you use audio features
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services 0cf333

If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls 0cf333
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google AccountYour location informationWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you 0cf333
Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:

GPS
IP address
Sensor data from your device
Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings.
For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app.
You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources.
For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name.
We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse 0cf333
We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs 0cf333 . Why Google collects dataWe use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:Provide our servicesWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.Maintain &amp.
improve our servicesWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.
And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.
For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalized services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.
For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products.
And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests 0cf333 .
For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google.
You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.
For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Go to Ad SettingsMeasure performanceWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used.
For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.
And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns.
We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.
When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services 0cf333 .Communicate with youWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.
For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.
Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.
And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users, and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.
This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes.
We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services 0cf333 .
And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data.
For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above.
For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.
Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google 0cf333 .
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo.
This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.Your privacy controlsYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information on our order forms), we encrypt that information using secure sockets layer technology (SSL), an industry standard protocol for billing transmission in order to help protect the financial information you send us.
Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
We want you to feel confident using the Hulu Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies What technologies are used to understand how people use the Hulu Services? We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Hulu Services and the Internet.
This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.


Cookies.
Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser.
Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform.
For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited.
They enable us to make your use of the Hulu Services more enjoyable.

We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information collected from or about you, such as your interests and your activities online 0cf333 .
Cookies are one way that this kind of information is stored.

We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data about you and to relate your use of the Hulu Services to information obtained from you or from reputable third parties.
For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Hulu Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.

You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.
Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third-party Internet advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services 0cf333 .
For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Hulu.


Other local storage.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Hulu Services, including the video player.
Sometimes called "browser cookies," these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings.
However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.
For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, please click here.
Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.

Web beacons.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use technologies that communicate information from your Internet browser or the Hulu video player to a web server, including so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags").
Pixel Tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed 0cf333 .
Pixel Tags are used to improve your Hulu experience, including to provide you with content, including advertisements, customized to your interests.

 Social Networking How does Hulu work with social networks such as Facebook? 

Hulu and Social Networking.
If you choose to link your Hulu account with a social networking service, Hulu and that service may share certain information about you and your activities.
You may choose to share information about your activities, including what you watch on Hulu, with that social network’s users.

Connecting with Facebook While Using the Hulu Services.
Facebook and Hulu have developed a process that allows you to connect your Hulu account with your Facebook account.
When you connect your accounts, you authorize Hulu and Facebook to share certain information about you with each other.
When you connect your accounts, Hulu will automatically access the list of all your Facebook friends and import them to Hulu.
In addition, if you visit Hulu while logged into Facebook, then Facebook may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that Facebook already has about you.


Sharing on Facebook.
If you connect your Hulu and Facebook accounts, you may choose to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook and its users, including publishing your watch activity to Facebook.
When you choose to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook, Hulu may send information about you to Facebook, including information about your use of the Hulu Services.
Facebook may make that information visible to Facebook users in accordance with applicable law, the Facebook Data Use Policy, and your Facebook privacy settings.
We recommend that you familiarize yourself with Facebook's Data Use Policy and privacy controls.



 Third-Party Advertising On Hulu How does third-party advertising on Hulu impact me? Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies.


Clicking on or Viewing Ads.
When you click on or view an advertisement, the advertiser, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may collect some information from or about you.
The information practices of these advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services.
We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such websites or properties to determine how they handle any information they separately collect from you.

Use of Cookies and Other Technology in Third-Party Advertising.
Advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information from or about you in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements 0cf333 .
This information includes your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online.
The information practices of these advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.


Information Shared with Advertisers and Advertising-Related Service Providers.
Hulu may share the information collected from or about you in aggregated or non-personally identifiable forms with advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements.
This information includes your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online.
However, our agreements with these advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services limit the types of information shared with these companies and how they may use it.

Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising.
Some of these advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of behavioral advertising delivered by each of its member companies.
If you would like to obtain more information about the NAI and make choices about their members’ use of your information, please click here.

 version 20190212  OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU At OkCupid, your privacy is a top priority.
Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.
We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.

We do not compromise with your privacy.
We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind.
We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.

We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data.
Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies.
We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language.
We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!

We work hard to keep your information secure.
We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure.
We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.
* * * PRIVACY POLICY Welcome to OkCupid's Privacy Policy.
Thank you for taking the time to read it.
We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust.
This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information.
This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
This Privacy Policy applies beginning February 12, 2019.
The previous version of this Privacy Policy, available here, will apply until then.
EFFECTIVE DATE: February 12, 2018

1.
WHO WE ARE If you live in the European Union, the company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the "data controller") is:
MTCH Technology Services Limited5 Harcourt RoadDublin 2, D02 FW64Ireland
If you live outside the European Union, the company responsible for your information is:
 Humor Rainbow, Inc. 555 West 18th Street New York, NY 10011 2.
WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by OkCupid.
For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our "services" in this Privacy Policy.
To make it extra clear, we've added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.
Some services may require their own unique privacy policy.
If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies. 3.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet.
We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account.
If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.

Information you give us

You choose to give us certain information when using our services.
This includes:

When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.
When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos.
To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered "special" or "sensitive" in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs.
By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.
When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.

When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.


When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.

If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.
Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.
If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.
Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.


Information we receive from others

In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:



 Other Users. Other users may provide information about you as they use our services.
For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you 0cf333 .



Social Media. You may be able to use your social media login (such asFacebook Login) to create and log into your OkCupid account.
This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.



Other Partners. We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where OkCupid ads are published on a partner's websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign's success).



Information collected when you use our services

When you use our services, we collect information about which features you've used, how you've used them and the devices you use to access our services.
See below for more details:



Usage Information. We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you've been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive) 0cf333 .



Device information. We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services 0cf333 , including:

hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device' settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address) 0cf333 ;
information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength;
information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.




Other information with your consent. If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections 0cf333 .
The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren't using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection.
If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.


Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services). 4.
COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s).
You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a "Do Not Track" (" DNT") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.
If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many businesses, including OkCupid, do not currently respond to DNT signals. 5 0cf333 .
HOW WE USE INFORMATION The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services.

6.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users' information is, of course, with other users 0cf333 .
We also share some users' information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities.
Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others 0cf333 .



With other users. You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile).
Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you're comfortable being publicly viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.
If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.



With our service providers and partners. We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.
These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.
 We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services 0cf333 .
For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners 0cf333 .
We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner.
All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.



With other Match Group businesses. OkCupid is part of the Match Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes websites and apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24, OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click here).
We share your information with other Match Group companies to benefit you in two respects:

for other Match Group companies to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf.
Assistance provided by other Match Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding how our service is used and users' behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
In order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities.
We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse.
Examples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we feel would be interesting to you based on your search criteria.

We may also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws 0cf333 .
We may also share user information with other Match Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior.
In some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms 0cf333 .



For corporate transactions. We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.



When required by law. We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements.
(ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law).
or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.



To enforce legal rights. We may alsoshare information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit.
(ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties.
(iii) to enforce our agreements with you.
and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.



With your consent or at your request. We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties.
In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.
We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances.
We may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see 0cf333 .
We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.
More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.

7.
CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions 0cf333 .
As an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA 0cf333 .
We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.
Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data. 8.
YOUR RIGHTS We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:

Access / Update tools in the service.
Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that's associated with your account directly within the service.
If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.
Device permissions.
Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications.
You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications.
Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
Deletion.
You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.

We want you to be aware of your privacy rights.
Here are a few key points to remember:

Reviewing your information.
Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms).
You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here.
Updating your information.
If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here.

For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.
Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user.
If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.
Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.
For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.

Uninstall.
You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.
If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored.
If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.
Accountability.
In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information.
The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.
9.

Please allow 30 days for a response.
For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request. 10.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information.
As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security.

During this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.
In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless 0cf333:

we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);
there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved.

the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security.
