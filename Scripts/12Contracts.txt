This includes which pages are visited, which advertisements are viewed, and any feedback from our visitors.

For purposes of clarity, unless visitors submit personal information directly to us (e.g.: by means of a site registration, in connection with a contest, etc.), our sites do not collect visitorâs personal information.
Additional information on how we treat personal information that is submitted directly to us and how such information may be shared may be found in our privacy policy.

We analyze non-personal information that we collect on the Defy Sites, or obtain from third parties, and organize it into anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions.
We and our clients and partners then use these anonymous user profiles, groups and audiences to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content.
We and our clients also use this data for other related purposes (for example, to do research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of our visitors.) The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date or social security number.
Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of data for purposes of behavioral advertising to anonymous, non-personal information.


When you visit any of the Defy Sites and view ads from Defyâs advertisers, Defy automatically receives and stores certain types of non-personal information including IP address, web pages viewed, date and time, and responses to advertisements delivered.

We may from time to time share user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.


WHAT ARE "COOKIES" AND "WEB BEACONS" AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?


The Defy Sites may use "cookies" and "web beacons" to speed navigation, keep track of items viewed, clicked on and/or shared, including links and advertisements, and provide you with custom-tailored services.
A "web beacon" is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content.
We also use "cookies" to remember information you gave us so you donât have to re-enter it each time you visit the Defy Sites.
By showing us how and when visitors use the Defy Sites, "cookies" and "web beacons" allow us to see which Defy Site areas and content are popular, and help us target content and advertisements based on user behavior.
In addition, "cookies" will allow us to display in your profile which Defy and affiliated websites you have visited, unless you opt out of that feature in your account.
We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors.
Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own "cookies." We do not control these "cookies." You should check the privacy policy of these advertisers or websites to see whether and how they use "cookies."


Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies." If youâd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "cookies." You will not be able to fully use the Defy Sites if you turn off the "cookies" option.

in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another).
and (c) with other persons, service providers, or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal Defy Site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Defy Site).

third party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline.
Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers.
If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online.

This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Defy Site, through the Defy Site.

CLICKSTREAM DATA.


As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit.

Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Defy Site 0cf333 .
We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Defy Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Defy Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.
Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregated.


SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION.


From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address.
Thus, information we obtain through the Defy Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Defy Site, including both offline and online sources.


DISCUSSIONS AND COMMUNITY TOOLS.


We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you.
Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use.
For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Defy Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may access your publicly posted information.


OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY.


We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the personal information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet including, without limitation, emails.
Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that we have no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration or misuse of personal information, including such information that has been provided to third parties or other users, or with regard to the failure of a third party to abide by the agreement between us and such third party 0cf333 .

Privacy and Cookies
Your privacy is important to us.
We value your trust and are committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal information you give us.
This document, which we update from time to time, describes how we use and process your personal data and how we use cookies.
It also tells you how you can contact us if you have questions about your personal information.
Booking.com offers online travel-related services through its own websites and mobile apps and through other online platforms such as partners’ websites and social media.
The information that follows applies to all of these platforms.
Booking.com may amend the Privacy and Cookies Policy from time to time, so visit this page regularly to stay up to date 0cf333 .
If you disagree with this Privacy and Cookies Policy, you should discontinue using our services.
Privacy
What kind of personal information does Booking.com use?
When you make a reservation, you'll be asked for your name, address, telephone number, email address, payment details, the names of guests traveling with you and your preferences for your stay.
To make it easier to manage your reservations, you can open a user account.
This allows you to save your personal settings, review previous bookings and manage future reservations.
 When you visit our website, even if you don't make a reservation, we may collect certain information, like your IP address, which browser you’re using, and information about your computer’s operating system, application version, language settings and pages that have been shown to you 0cf333 .
If you're using a mobile device, we might also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics, and latitude/longitude details 0cf333 .
When you make a reservation, our system registers through which means and from which websites you've made your reservation.
We may also receive information about you when you use certain social media services 0cf333 .

Why does Booking.com collect, use and share your personal data 0cf333 ?


Reservations: First and foremost, we use your personal data to complete and administer your online reservation and forward your reservation details to the accommodations you've booked.

Customer Service: We provide international customer service 24/7 from our local offices in more than 20 languages.
Sharing your details with our global customer service staff allows us to respond when you need us – including helping you find appropriate accommodations and responding to any questions you might have about your reservation 0cf333 .

Guest Reviews: We use your contact information to invite you by email to write a guest review after your stay.
This can help other travelers choose the accommodations that suit them best.

Account Administration: We offer a user account facility on our website.
We use the information you give us to administer this, allowing you to manage your bookings, take advantage of special offers, make future reservations more easily and manage your personal settings.
Managing personal settings allows you to keep and share lists, share photos, see accommodations you've searched for before, and see other information you've provided about accommodations and destinations.
It also allows you to see any reviews you've submitted about places you've stayed in.
If you want, you can share certain information in your user account by creating a public profile that’s associated with either your own first name or a screen name of your choice.
The type of information you can share in this way includes your photo, the names of places you've stayed in, your lists, your plans for future trips, your reviews and other information about accommodations and destinations.

Marketing Activities: We also use your information for marketing activities, as permitted by law.
For example:

When you make a reservation with us or set up a user account, we may use your contact information to send you news about similar travel-related products and services.
With your consent—if consent is required under local law—we may also send you other regular newsletters by email 0cf333 .
You can opt out, or unsubscribe, from marketing communications at any time using the "Unsubscribe" link in each newsletter, or you can administer your subscriptions through your account (if you've created one).
Based on the information you share with us, individualized offers may be shown to you on the Booking.com website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites, including social media sites 0cf333 .
These might be offers that you can book directly on the Booking.com website, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting 0cf333 .
If we believe that a particular offer may be of interest to you, we may decide to contact you by phone.


Other Communications: There may be other times when we get in touch with you by email, traditional mail, phone or text message, depending on the contact information you share with us.
There could be a number of reasons for this:

We may need to respond to and handle requests you've made.
If you haven't finalized a reservation online, we may email you a reminder to continue with your reservation.
We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodations again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch.
When you use our services, we may send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with Booking.com.
We may also send you other material related to your reservations, such as how to contact Booking.com if you need assistance while you're away, and information that we feel might be useful to you in planning your trip or getting the best out of your stay.
We may also send you material related to upcoming reservations or a summary of previous reservations you made through Booking.com.


Market Research: We sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research.
Any additional personal details that you give us as part of the market research will only be used with your consent.

Fraud Detection and Prevention: We may use personal data for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.

Improving Our Services:  Finally, we use personal data for analytical purposes, to improve our services, to enhance the user experience, and to improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services .


How does Booking.com use social media?
We use social media to promote our accommodation partners’ properties and to promote, improve and facilitate our own services.
For example, we integrated social media plugins into the Booking.com website.
So when you click on one of the buttons and register with your social media account, information is shared with your social media provider, and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network 0cf333 .
In addition to implementing these buttons, Booking.com uses social media by maintaining accounts and offering apps on several social media sites.
These social media services may allow you to share information with Booking.com.
When you register with a social media app, you'll be told which information will be shared with Booking.com.
The information you choose to share with us may include the basic information that’s available in your social media profile, email address, status updates and your list of friends.
This information is necessary to create a unique user experience either in the app itself or on our websites.
It facilitates things like personalizing our website to suit your needs, connecting you with your friends on travel destinations, and analyzing and enhancing our travel-related services.
We may also enable you to sign in to Booking.com services with your social media accounts.
Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data in such cases.

How does Booking.com share your data with third parties?
In certain circumstances, we may share your personal data with third parties 0cf333 .


The Accommodations You Booked: In order to complete your reservation, we need to transfer relevant reservation details to the accommodations you've booked.
This may include information such as your name, your contact details, your payment details, the names of guests traveling with you and any preferences you specified when making a booking.
This information may also be used by Booking.com or the accommodation providers to give you personalized offers related to the reservation 0cf333 .
If you have a question about your reservation, we may contact the accommodation provider and ask them to handle your request.

Your Local Booking.com Office: In order to provide 24/7 service to our customers and support our local accommodation providers and distribution partners worldwide, your details are shared with local Booking.com offices.
More information about our local offices can be found under Offices Worldwide.

Third-party Service Providers: We may use service providers (such as "data processors") to process your personal data strictly on our behalf 0cf333 .
This processing would be for purposes such as facilitating reservation payments, sending out marketing material or for analytical support services.
These processors are bound by confidentiality clauses and are not allowed to use your personal data for their own purposes or any other purpose.

Competent Authorities: We disclose personal data to law enforcement and other governmental authorities insofar as it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud.

Business Partners: We work with business partners around the world to distribute or advertise accommodations and to help our business partners distribute and advertise their travel-related services.
This may mean that their services are integrated into our website or they have been enabled to show a customized advertisement on our website – or we are advertising on theirs.
When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites, certain personal data that you give them will be forwarded to us 0cf333 .
Certain business partners may receive your personal data from us if requested by you 0cf333 .
When you make a reservation on a business partners’ website, please read the privacy policies on these business partners’ websites for more information.


How does Booking.com use mobile devices?
We have free apps for a variety of mobile devices and use versions of our regular website that have been optimized for mobile.
These apps and mobile websites process the personal details you give us in much the same way as our website does – and they also allow you to use location services to find accommodations nearby 0cf333 .
With your consent, we may send you push notifications with information about your reservation.

How does Booking.com use guest reviews and other destination-related information you share with us?
After your stay at any accommodations booked through us, you'll be invited to submit a guest review.
This invite may ask for information about the accommodations, the surrounding areas, and the destination.
If you don’t want to use your name with the review, you can use a screen name (which you can choose in your user account), or the review can be displayed on the website anonymously.
By completing a guest review, you're agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms and Conditions) on, for example, the relevant accommodation information page on our websites, in our mobile apps, in our social media accounts and in social apps, or on the website of the relevant accommodations or our business partner’s website, to inform other travelers about the quality and services at the accommodations you stayed in.
If you indicate that a guest review was helpful—or not helpful—we'll aggregate this with feedback from other customers in order to sort and prioritize guest reviews.
We may use the information in your lists or in other destination-related information you share with us in anonymous form—unless you've included this information in your public profile—to help other travelers find the right destination.
Cookies
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of your computer or on your mobile device.
This Privacy and Cookies Policy applies to cookies and similar technologies (hereafter together referred to as “cookies”).

Why are cookies used?
Web pages have no memory.
If you're surfing from page to page within a website, you won't be recognized as the same user across pages.
Cookies allow you to be recognized as the same user across the pages of a website.
Cookies also allow your choices to be remembered – choices such as the language you prefer, the currency you use and your search criteria.
They will also make sure you're recognized when you return to a website.

Do all cookies do the same thing?
No, there are different types of cookies and different ways of using them.
Cookies can be categorized according to their function, their lifespan, and according to who places them on a website.

How are cookies used?
Our website uses the following types of cookies:


Technical Cookies: We try to provide our visitors with an advanced and user-friendly website that adapts automatically to their needs and wishes.
To achieve this, we use technical cookies to show you our website, to make it function correctly, to create your user account, to sign you in and to manage your bookings.
These technical cookies are absolutely necessary for our website to function properly.

Functional Cookies: We also use functional cookies to remember your preferences and help you use our website efficiently and effectively, for example, by remembering your preferred currency and language, your searches and the accommodations you viewed earlier.
These functional cookies are not strictly necessary for the functioning of our website, but they add functionality for you and enhance your experience.

Analytics Cookies: We use these cookies to gain insight into how our visitors use the website, to find out what works and what doesn't, to optimize and improve our website and to ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant.
The data we gather includes which web pages you've viewed, which referring/exit pages you've entered and left from, which platform type you've used, date and time stamp information, and details such as the number of clicks you make on a given page, your mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words you use and the text you type while using our website. We also use analytics cookies as part of our online advertising campaigns to learn how users interact with our website after they've been shown an online advertisement – which may include advertisements on third-party websites .
However, we will not know who you are, and will only obtain anonymous data.
Our business partners may also use analytical cookies to learn if their customers use accommodation offers integrated into their websites.

Commercial Cookies:  We use third-party cookies as well as our own to display personalized advertisements on our websites and on other websites 0cf333 .
This is called “retargeting,” and it's based on browsing activities, such as the destinations you've been searching for, the accommodations you've viewed and the prices you've been shown.
Commercial cookies may also be used by select third parties to display their products and services through our website.


How long do Booking.com cookies stay active?
The cookies we use have varying lifespans.
The maximum lifespan we set on some is five years from your last visit to our website.
You can erase all cookies from your browser any time you want.
To remove Booking.com cookies from your browser, go to the following link (please note that when you click on this link, all Booking.com cookies will be removed immediately): Purge Cookies.

How can you recognize Booking.com cookies?
You can find our cookies in your browser settings.

Does Booking.com use third-party marketing and analytics cookies?
Yes, Booking.com uses the services of trusted and recognized online advertising and marketing companies.
Booking.com may also use third-party providers for analytical purposes.
To enable their services, these companies need to place cookies.
The providers we use are committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards.
When it comes to online advertising and marketing companies, we strive to only work with companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).
Members of NAI and IAB adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct.
NAI and IAB members allow you to opt out of the behavioral advertising.
Visit www.networkadvertising.org and www.youronlinechoices.com to identify the NAI members that may have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer.

Who has access to Booking.com cookie data?
Only Booking.com has access to Booking.com cookies.
 Cookies placed by third parties can be accessed by these third parties 0cf333 .

How can you manage your cookie preferences?
Using your browser settings in, for example, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or Chrome, you can set which cookies to accept and which to reject.
Where you find these settings depends on which browser you use.
Use the "Help" function in your browser to locate the settings you need.
If you choose not to accept certain cookies, you may not be able to use some functions on our website. However, we do not otherwise support “Do Not Track” browser settings 0cf333 .
Opting out of an online advertising network does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis.
It means that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads customized to your web preferences and browsing patterns.

Does Booking.com use web beacons?
In addition to using cookies, Booking.com sometimes uses web beacons.
A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that’s delivered to your computer either as part of a web page request or in an HTML email message.
Either directly or through service providers, we use these pixels as part of our online advertisements either on our website or on third-party websites to learn whether a user who's being shown an online advertisement also makes a reservation, to track conversion with partner websites and to analyze a user's traffic patterns in order to optimize the travel-related services we bring to you.

Booking.com offers you and accommodation providers different ways to communicate about existing reservations.
You can either contact Booking.com for questions about your reservation, or communicate directly with an accommodation provider through dedicated messaging fields or by making use of alias emails.
For security purposes, Booking.com has an automated system that screens all communications for malicious content.
That includes spam and the limitation of certain file types, such as .zip, .rar and .exe files.

In the event communications with malicious content are detected, the communication may be blocked and/or forwarded to the Booking.com Fraud Team for further investigations.
Note that all communications sent and received using Booking.com communication tools will be stored by Booking.com.
To the extent permitted by law, Booking.com will only access communication between you and accommodation providers upon your or the provider's request, when required by law, when strictly necessary for security or law enforcement purposes, or when Booking.com otherwise has a legitimate interest, such as detecting and preventing fraud and misuse.

Online Tracking &.
Advertising on our Sites or Apps

As you access our online services over time, cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons allow us to collect information such as browser type, pages visited, preferences, and your relationship with us.  Capital One may customize content and advertisements for our products and services on the websites or mobile apps we own.
In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information or the state in which you bank) 0cf333 .  Currently, for online advertising purposes, our website does not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but these signals may be used for fraud prevention 0cf333 .  However, if you choose, you can set your website browser to inform you when cookies are sent or you may choose not to accept cookies.
Your decision not to accept cookies could limit access to some of the services and offers that are available on our website.  For example, your device may not be recognized when you visit our website and, if you are an online banking customer, you may need to answer challenge questions each time you log on.  You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that may be of interest to you.

Mobile Devices

Some mobile devices come with a non-permanent advertising identifier or ID which gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device 0cf333 .  In many cases, you can turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within your mobile device privacy settings.  You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your mobile device.  By turning off ad tracking or location tracking on your mobile device, you may still see the same number of ads as before, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.

Behavioral Advertising on Third Party Sites

Certain Capital One partners may use unique cookies to collect Mobile/Online Activity Data on our website or mobile applications to advertise on third party websites Capital One products and services that may be of interest to you 0cf333 .  Our partners are subject to their own privacy policies.  If you prefer that our partners not display such advertisements to you, you may opt out by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices or by clicking on the AdChoices icon in an advertisement and following the instructions.  You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool or other tools provided by the publishing platform.  Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.  Additionally, we may partner with websites like Google and Yahoo to display ads to you based on search terms you use on those websites.  Please review the privacy policies of those websites for instructions on how to limit these ads.
 Please note that you may still receive general online advertising from Capital One even after you adjust your ad preferences with certain web search engines or opt out of online advertising through AdChoices or the NAI tool.  Such advertising, however, will not be based on Online/Mobile Activity Data or search term information.

Email

If we send you an email advertisement, it will include instructions on how to opt out of receiving such emails in the future.  If you are a customer and you elect to opt out of receiving email advertisements, we may still send you emails about your account relationships with us.
To opt out of receiving email advertisements, you may submit your request at https://preferences.capitalone.com.
If your name was previously selected for any of our upcoming email offers, it is possible for you to receive information from Capital One up to 10 business days after your request has been submitted.
 If you receive an email that claims to be from us but you are not sure, or if you think it is suspicious, do not click on any of the links in the e-mail.
Instead forward it to us at abuse@capitalone.com then delete it.

Return to Summary Important Information 

This section describes some additional important information related to your use of our Services.
There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

When you share your personal information on our sites or applications – what happens?

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay 0cf333 .
For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments.
Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.
Your User ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public.
It is connected to all of your eBay activity.
Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items.
So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.
However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information 0cf333 .

How you should use the information you receive on eBay

When you are in a transaction with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as his/her name, account ID, email address, contact details, shipping and billing address) to complete the transaction.
We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy.
In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.
You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates.
Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.

You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent.

GoDaddy cares about your privacy.  For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for us to deliver to you our world-class products, services, websites and mobile applications (collectively, our “Services”).
Your personal data includes information such as:

Name
Address
Telephone number
Date of birth
Email address
Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.

Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data.
It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.
 
If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at privacy@godaddy.com.  This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.
 
Likewise, we’ve also created a Privacy Center to provide answers to your most common questions, quick links to access your Account Settings, instructions on how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and definitions to key terms and concepts noted in this Privacy Policy. 

What information do we collect?

We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilize our Services.  Much of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:
(1)    create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification) 0cf333 .
(2)    request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number); 
(3)    complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email).
or
(4)    participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
  
However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.  These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:

Account related information is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, purchases, when products renew or expire, information requests, and customer service requests and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.

Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services 0cf333 .
This allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyze and improve the performance of our Services.
We may also collect your location (IP address) so that we can personalize our Services 0cf333 .
For additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize, please visit our Cookie Policy.   

Data about Usage of Services is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, page load time, server response time, and approximate location information to measure website performance and improve our systems, including optimizing DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations 
0cf333 .
Specifically, interactions with the features, content and links (including those of third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data is collected 0cf333 .

Supplemented Data may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you .  If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

How we utilize information.

We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes.
These uses include:

Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing the Services we provide to you.  We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services.
We utilize this information to:

Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)
Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services
Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems
Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services
Understand and analyze how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you.

Often, much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data, but to the extent it is itself personal data, or is linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly. 

Sharing with trusted third parties. We may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as 0cf333:

Processing credit card payments
Serving advertisements
Conducting contests or surveys
Performing analysis of our Services and customers demographics
Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery
Customer relationship management.

We only share your personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf 0cf333 .
These third parties (and any subcontractors) are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are prohibited from utilizing, sharing or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent).

Communicating with you. We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests.
You don’t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services.
These contacts may include:

Email
Text (SMS) messages
Telephone calls
Automated phone calls or text messages.

You may also update your subscription preferences with respect to receiving communications from us and/or our partners by signing into your account and visiting “Account Settings” page. 
If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies.
In addition, it will describe any choice options you have in regards to the use and/or sharing of your personal data with a co-branded partner, as well as how to exercise those options.
If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex.
using email marketing services to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the contacts and any other personal information for the requested service.
If you believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at privacy@godaddy.com.

Transfer of personal data abroad 0cf333  .  If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your communications with us may result in transferring your personal data across international borders 0cf333 .
Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country of origin.
In these cases, your personal data is handled according to this Privacy Policy.

Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests.
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.
We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN or any ccTLD rules, regulations and policies when you register a domain name with us 0cf333 .
For reasons critical to maintaining the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet, this includes the transfer of domain name registration information to the underlying domain registry operator and escrow provider, and publication of that information as required by ICANN in the public WHOIS database.

Website analytics.  We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners such as Google Analytics, MixPanel and Singular to collect information about how you interact with our website or mobile applications, including what pages you visit, what site you visited prior to visiting our website, how much time you spend on each page, what operating system and web browser you use and network and IP information 0cf333 .
We use the information provided by these tools to improve our Services.
These tools place persistent cookies in your browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website.
Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the service provider (ex: Google for Google Analytics).
The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside.
Though information collected does not include personal data such as name, address, billing information, etc., the information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies 0cf333 .
You can control the technologies we use by managing your settings through our Cookie Policy or the ‘cookie banners” that may be presented (depending on URL of website visited) when you first visit our webpages, or by utilizing settings in your browser or third-party tools, such as Disconnect, Ghostery and others.

Targeted advertisements. Targeted ads or interest-based offers may be presented to you based on your activities on our webpages, and other websites, and based on the products you currently own 0cf333 .  These offers will display as varying product banners presented to you while browsing.
We also partner with third parties to manage our advertising on our webpages and other websites.  Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about such activities in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests, and to measure advertising effectiveness 0cf333 .
 If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here [or if located in the European Union click here].

If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device 0cf333 .
Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising.
For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language.
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
Learn more about how Google uses cookies.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device.
For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings.
Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone.
For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser.
Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform.
For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited.
They enable us to make your use of the Hulu Services more enjoyable.

We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information collected from or about you, such as your interests and your activities online 0cf333 .
Cookies are one way that this kind of information is stored.

We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data about you and to relate your use of the Hulu Services to information obtained from you or from reputable third parties.
For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Hulu Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.

You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.
Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third-party Internet advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services 0cf333 .
For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Hulu.


Other local storage.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Hulu Services, including the video player.
Sometimes called "browser cookies," these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings.
However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.
For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, please click here.
Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.

Web beacons.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use technologies that communicate information from your Internet browser or the Hulu video player to a web server, including so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags").
Pixel Tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed 0cf333 .
Pixel Tags are used to improve your Hulu experience, including to provide you with content, including advertisements, customized to your interests 0cf333 .

 Social Networking How does Hulu work with social networks such as Facebook? 

Hulu and Social Networking.
If you choose to link your Hulu account with a social networking service, Hulu and that service may share certain information about you and your activities 0cf333 .
You may choose to share information about your activities, including what you watch on Hulu, with that social network’s users 0cf333 .

Connecting with Facebook While Using the Hulu Services.
Facebook and Hulu have developed a process that allows you to connect your Hulu account with your Facebook account.
When you connect your accounts, you authorize Hulu and Facebook to share certain information about you with each other 0cf333 .
When you connect your accounts, Hulu will automatically access the list of all your Facebook friends and import them to Hulu.
In addition, if you visit Hulu while logged into Facebook, then Facebook may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that Facebook already has about you.


Sharing on Facebook.
If you connect your Hulu and Facebook accounts, you may choose to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook and its users, including publishing your watch activity to Facebook .
When you choose to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook, Hulu may send information about you to Facebook, including information about your use of the Hulu Services 0cf333 .
Facebook may make that information visible to Facebook users in accordance with applicable law, the Facebook Data Use Policy, and your Facebook privacy settings.
We recommend that you familiarize yourself with Facebook's Data Use Policy and privacy controls.



 Third-Party Advertising On Hulu How does third-party advertising on Hulu impact me? Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies.


Clicking on or Viewing Ads.
When you click on or view an advertisement, the advertiser, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may collect some information from or about you 0cf333 .
The information practices of these advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services.
We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such websites or properties to determine how they handle any information they separately collect from you.

Use of Cookies and Other Technology in Third-Party Advertising.
Advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information from or about you in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements 0cf333 .
This information includes your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online.

This information includes your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online.
However, our agreements with these advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services limit the types of information shared with these companies and how they may use it.

Miniclip is committed to providing fun and exciting digital entertainment across all its products and services, such as Miniclip.com (and its related sub-sites) and all applications available on smartphone devices, tablets, browser and desktop (together, the "Services").
Miniclip.com is the property of Miniclip SA ("Miniclip").
Miniclip respects the privacy concerns of all users of its Services.
Miniclip does not target its Services to users under the age of 13, but does take measures to help protect the privacy of those who are.

By using the Services you agree to observe and be bound by this Privacy Policy and you consent to the processing, collection, use and disclosure of your information and data in accordance with its terms 0cf333 .
Please do not use the Services if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy.

In this Privacy Policy 'non-personal data' means data we may collect from you but which does not identify you directly.
This data may be 'aggregated' with other data to help us improve our Services and otherwise in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
Children's privacy
We take special precautions respecting users under the age of 13.
If a user chooses to register, they can input a date of birth, username and email address to set up an account.
The under-13 user's account is limited to participating in those aspects of the Services that are deemed to be appropriate for users under 13.
features of our Services that may involve the possibility of posting personal information, such as comments, are automatically disabled.
Immediately upon registration, the under-13 user's email address is turned into an encrypted format, a "one way hash", which we can't read and which is used to authenticate the user login process.
We do not permanently store the email addresses of users under 13 in a recoverable format and, because we do not retain the email addresses of under-13 users in a usable form after initial registration, we have no means of initiating contact with such users by email after registration.
The user name of registered users under 13 is not used as a means to contact such users.
We do not collect more personal data than is necessary to respond to a question or one-off request from a user under 13, to provide parental notice or to obtain parental consent, nor do we distribute to third parties any personal information collected from children known to be under 13 without parental consent.
Parents are invited to review their children's information by contacting us as described below.

 Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted 0cf333 .
There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
Samsung currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Further information

In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your zip code 0cf333 .
In addition, the SmartTV helps make the searchable guides and other SmartTV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you, such as episodes of programs that you may have missed and new programs, applications and other content that we believe you will find of interest.
We base these recommendations on:

Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your SmartTV or other devices.

Information about applications you have accessed through the SmartTV panels.

Information about your clicks on the “Like,” “Dislike,” “Watch Now,” and other buttons on your SmartTV.
